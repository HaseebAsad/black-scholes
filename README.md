# black-scholes
The Black-Scholes set of partial differential equations is a popular model used for options pricing, it is named after economists Fischer Black and Myron Scholes.
The assumptions about the market are:

No arbitrage opportunity (i.e., there is no way to make a riskless profit).
-Ability to borrow and lend any amount, even fractional, of cash at the riskless rate.
-Ability to buy and sell any amount, even fractional, of the stock (this includes short selling).
-The above transactions do not incur any fees or costs (i.e., frictionless market).
